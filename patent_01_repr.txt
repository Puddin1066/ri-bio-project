This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional \nPatent Application No. 61/429,555, filed on Jan. 4, 2012 and \nis hereby incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for \nall purposes. \n\nSTATEMENT OF GOVERNMENT INTERESTS \n0002  This invention was made with government support \nunder National  Institutes  of Health  grant  number NIH \nP2ORRO24484 and R21 AGO27521. The Government has \ncertain rights in the invention. \n\nFIELD \n0003  Embodiments of the present disclosure relate to the \nuse of rosette nanotubes to deliver nucleic acids into cells. \nEmbodiments of the present disclosure still further relate to \ncomplexes of rosette nanotubes and nucleic acids and com \npositions thereof and the use of such complexes to deliver \nnucleic acids into the cells of individuals for therapeutic \npurposes.  Embodiments of the present disclosure further \nrelate to the use of rosette nanotubes to deliver interference \nRNA into cells. Embodiments of the present disclosure fur \nther relate to methods of inhibiting target RNA within a cell \nusing  complexes  of rosette  nanotubes and Small  RNA. \nEmbodiments of the present disclosure still further relate to \ntransfection complexes of rosette nanotubes and nucleic acids \nsuch as DNA and RNA and compositions thereof and the use \nof such transfection complexes to introduce the DNA or RNA \ninto cells, for example as a therapeutic treatment. \n\nBACKGROUND \n\n0004  RNA interference (RNAi) is a system in living cells \nthat helps control genes activity. Mediators of RNAi include \ntwo classes of small RNA including microRNA (miRNA) and \nsmall interfering RNA (siRNA). Interference RNA molecules \nhave been used to silence genes and consequently their gene \nproducts and more efficiently than antisense RNA alone. See \nRocheleau CE, et al., Cell 1997: 90:707-716.) Interference \nRNA molecules have been used to study the role of proteins in \nsignal transduction pathways and it has also been Suggested \nthat these molecules might be useful in treating a variety of \ndiseases in which the causative protein is overexpressed. See \nArenz et al., Naturwissenschafien 2003: 90:345-359; Coburn \net al., J Antimicrob Chemother 2003; 51:753-756. To avoid \nnonspecific  gene  silencing  induced  by  longer  double \nstranded RNA, small interfering RNAs, a duplex of 21-23 \nnucleotides, have been used as mediators to degrade target \nmRNA. See Fire et al., Nature 1998; 391:806-811.) Once \ninside the cell, siRNA is incorporated into an RNA-induced \nsilence complex (RISC), a protein-RNA complex that results \nin unwinding and strand separation of the RNA duplex. The \nantisense RNA then guides the activated RISC to anneal and \ncleave the target mRNA. See Hammond et al., Nature 2000; \n404:293-296; Reynolds et al., Nat Biotechnol 2004; 22:326 \n330; Hammond et al., Science 2001; 293:1146-1150; and \nBernstein et al., Nature 2001: 409:363-366. \n0005.  Both viral and nonviral carriers have been used to \ncarry interference RNA to their cytosolic mRNA target. See \nSimeoni et  al.,  Nucleic Acids  Res 2003;  31:2717-2724. \n\nHighly branched HK peptides have also been Suggested as \ncarriers of siRNA to transfect eukaryotic cells. See U.S. Pat. \nNo. 7,772.201. \n0006.  The lipophilic  nature  of biological  membranes \nrestricts direct intracellular delivery of potential drugs or \nmolecular probes. There is a need in the art for transfection \ncomplexes  having  transfection  efficiencies  sufficient  to \ndeliver small RNA into the interior of cells, such as therapeu \ntically effective amounts of siRNA into target cells. There is \nalso a need in the art for carriers that are stable in serum for \ndelivery systems to be effective both in vitro and in vivo. \n0007.  It is a further object of the present invention to create \ncomplexes of RNA with rosette nanotubes that can be deliv \nered into target cells where the RNA can then function to \nsilence certain RNA and thereby prevent expression of an \nassociated protein or proteins. It is a further object of the \npresent invention to provide methods of treating individuals \nusing a delivery system of a complex of RNA with a rosette \nnanotube which transfects cells of the individual in a manner \nto prevent expression of an associated protein or proteins. \nThese and other objects, features, and advantages of the \ninvention or certain embodiments of the invention will be \napparent to those skilled in the art from the following disclo \nSure and description of exemplary embodiments. \n\nSUMMARY \n\n0008  Embodiments of the present disclosure are directed \nto methods of transfecting cells with nucleic acids or poly \nnucleotides such as DNA or RNA, such as small RNA and its \nderivatives, mimic, and inhibitors. RNA according to aspects \nof the present disclosure includes a duplex of nucleic acids of \nbetween about 10 to about 30 nucleotides. Embodiments of \nthe present disclosure include the formation of a composite or \ncomplex or combination of one or more nucleic acids, such as \nRNA, and a rosette nanotube where the one or more nucleic \nacids are attached to or otherwise bound to the rosette nano \ntube.  Embodiments of the present disclosure are further \ndirected to a product made by the process of mixing together \nrosette nanotubes as described herein or modules forming \nrosette nanotubes as described herein and one or more nucleic \nacids in aqueous media under conditions which cause the \nrosette nanotubes to combine with the one or more nucleic \nacids to form a complex or combination in aqueous media \nwhere the one or more nucleic acids are attached or otherwise \nbound through steric, ionic, covalent or other forces to the \nrosette nanotube. \n0009  Embodiments further include delivering the com \nposite  into  living  cells.  Embodiments further  include  a \nmethod of treating an individual requiring treatment compris \ning administering a complex of a rosette nanotube and one or \nmore nucleic acids to the individual in a manner to transfect \ncells within the individual with the one or more nucleic acids. \nEmbodiments further include a method of treating an indi \nvidual requiring treatment comprising administering a com \nplex of a rosette nanotube and one or more nucleic acids to the \nindividual in a manner to transfect cells within the individual \nwith the one or more nucleic acids and wherein the cells either \nexpress the one or more nucleic acids in a therapeutic manner \nor the one or more nucleic acids inhibit expression of one or \nmore proteins within the cells in a therapeutic manner. \n00.10  Embodiments  further  include  modulating  gene \nexpression or cell function by using small RNA delivered by \na composite of a rosette nanotube and small RNA. The result \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\nof the modulation of gene expression or cell function can be \ntherapeutic for particular indications. \n0011 \nFurther aspects include delivering small RNA into \ncells and the use of the delivered small RNA to regulate cell \nsignaling and function and influencing tissue or organ activi \nties. In particular, methods are provided of introducing Small \nRNA into cells using rosette nanotubes that advantageously \ndo not require additional chemical modification of the com \nponents of the delivery complex. The rosette nanotube and \nsmall RNA complexes of the present disclosure are advanta \ngeous in that they are nontoxic at administration levels and \nthey lack metals associated with known carriers. \n0012.  In particular,  the  methods include contacting a \ntransfection complex with one or more cells, where the trans \nfection complex includes a rosette nanotube (“RNT) and a \nnucleic acid such as DNA or RNA, for example siRNA or \nmiRNA.  Rosette  nanotubes  or  RNTs include  nanotubes \nformed from modules having twin bases with a linker or TBL. \nSuch rosette nanotubes may be referred to herein as “TBLs.” \nAccording to this aspect, the nucleic acid is delivered into the \ncell. According to one aspect, the DNA is expressed by the \ntransfected cell. According to an additional aspect, the RNA \ninteracts  with target  RNA to  regulate  gene expression. \nAccording to one aspect, the DNA or RNA is released from \nthe rosette nanotube after entry into the cell. According to an \nadditional aspect, the DNA or RNA remains attached to, \nbound to, or complexed with or combined with the rosette \nnanotube. \n0013.  According to one aspect, a transfection complex is \nproduced by combining modules of a self-assembled rosette \nnanotube and one or more nucleic acids as DNA or RNA, for \nexample siRNA or miRNA, in media where the modules \nself-assemble into a rosette nanotube which incorporates the \none or more nucleic acids to form a complex of a rosette \nnanotube and the one or more nucleic acids. According to an \nadditional aspect, a transfection complex is produced by com \nbining a self-assembled rosette nanotube and one or more \nnucleic acids such as DNA or RNA, for example siRNA or \nmiRNA, in media whereupon the one or more nucleic acids \nare incorporated into the rosette nanotube to form a complex \nof a rosette nanotube and one or more nucleic acids. The \ntransfection complex may then be contacted to cells where \nupon the transfection complex enters the cells. Without wish \ning to be bound by scientific theory, it is believes that the \ncomplex may enter cells by endocytosis. According to certain \nembodiments, the cells may be transformed cells, recombi \nnant cells, malignant cells, or cells from primary cell lines. \nThe transfection method may be performed on cells in vitro or \n1  V1VO. \n0014.  The modules may be any of those known to persons \nof ordinary skill in the art such as GMC motifs, unmodified or \nmodified to include moieties or sidechains, which self-as \nsemble into helical  rosette  nanotubes. According to  one \nembodiment, modules are placed into an aqueous medium \nwhere they self assemble into a Substructure such as a ring \nstructure, such as a rosette, and the ring structures then self \nassemble by stacking one on top of another to form a tubular \nstructure, commonly referred to as a nanotube. Such modules, \nSubstructures and nanometer scale molecular structures and \ntheir self-assembly is described in U.S. Pat. No. 6,696.565, \nFenniri et al.,  J. Am. Cheni. Soc.  2001, 123, 3854-3855, \nMoralez et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc., 2005, 127, 8307-8309, Fine \net al., International Journal of Nanomedicine 2009:49.1-97; \n\nand Zhang et al., Biomaterials 2009; 30(7): 1309-1320 each \nof which are hereby incorporated by reference in their entire \nties for all purposes. \n0015  Rosette nanotubes of the present disclosure are very \nstable in water and lack virus-related safety concerns and \ntoxicity at amounts of about 1  g/ml. See Int. J. Nanomedi \ncine,  2008, 3(3):373-383. Small. 2008, 4(6): 817-823; and \nAm. J.  Physiol Lung Cell Mol. Physiol. 2005, November; \n289(5):L698-708 each of which are hereby incorporated by \nreference in their entireties. \n0016.  According to one aspect of the present disclosure, \nmethods are provided where the self-assembly of precursers \nor modules incorporates the nucleic acid into or otherwise \ncomplexes the nucleic acid with, the self-assembled rosette \nnanotube. According to  another aspect,  fully  assembled \nrosette nanotubes can be incubated with one or more or a \nplurality of nucleic acids and the one or more or plurality of \nnucleic acids can complex with the fully assembled rosette \nnanotube to form a composite. According to one further \naspect, the one or more or plurality of nucleic acids are joined \nto or bound to the self-assembled rosette nanotube through \nsteric, ionic, Van der Waals, dispersion or other noncovalent \ninteractions to form a rosette nanotube and nucleic acid com \nplex useful as a transfection agent and in some cases in the \npreparation of a pharmaceutical agent to be administered to \nan individual. According to an additional further aspect, the \none or more nucleic acids are covalently attached by methods \nknown to those of skill in the art to the rosette nanotube to \nform a rosette nanotube and RNA complex useful as a trans \nfection agent and in Some cases in the preparation of a phar \nmaceutical agent to be administered to an individual. \n0017.  According to certain aspects, rosette nanotubes are \nfunctionalized with small  RNA to  form a complex, for \nexample RNA is bound to the rosette nanotube, the complex \nis translocated into a cell, and the intracellular small RNA is \npresent within the cell in an amount Sufficient for gene silenc \ning resulting in the inhibition of the production of target \nproteins. In this aspect, the rosette nanotube is a delivery \nvehicle or carrier for the small RNA into a cell for RNA \ninterference purposes. \n0018.  According to an alternate aspect, nanotubes are \nfunctionalized with desired DNA to form a complex, the \ncomplex is translocated into a cell, and the desired DNA is \nreleased from the complex and incorporated into the DNA of \nthe cell. The desired DNA is then expressed by the cell. In this \naspect, the rosette nanotube is a delivery vehicle or carrier for \nthe desired DNA into a cell for expression purposes. One of \nskill in the art will readily understand based on the present \ndisclosure that target DNA, such as a gene to be expressed, \ncan be transfected into a cell using the delivery vehicles and \ntechniques described herein or readily available to those of \nskill in the art, and thereafter expressed using methods known \nto those of skill in the art. \n0019  Embodiments of the present invention are still fur \nther directed to compositions including rosette nanotube? \nnucleic acid complexes used as a vehicle for the delivery of \nthe nucleic acid. Such as RNA into aparticular cell. According \nto certain embodiments, the rosette nanotube and RNA com \nplexes are mixed with a pharmaceutically acceptable excipi \nent or delivery vehicle and then delivered to the desired loca \ntion and in a manner to transfect cells with the RNA, for \nexample, for therapeutic purposes through the inhibition or \nalteration of the expression of a target gene. In addition, \ntransfection kits are provided that include the rosette nano \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\ntubes of the present invention for complexing with one or \nmore desired nucleic acids using the methods described \nherein pursuant to instructions and optional reagents pro \nvided in the kit to form a transfection reagent for transfection \nof a desired cell. \n\nBRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS \n0020  FIG. 1 shows the structure of an exemplary module \nused to form a rosette nanotube.

However, it is to be \nunderstood that the two double ring structures need not be \nidentical insofar as they may have different X and R groups. \n0056.  The term “amino acid\' is inclusive of the 20 com \nmon amino acids, as well as “nonstandard amino acids.” for \nexample, D-amino acids and chemically (or biologically) \nproduced derivatives of “common  amino acids, including \nfor example, 3-amino acids. \n0057  Accordingly, amino acids according to the present \ndisclosure include the commonly known amino acids such as \nglycine (Gly, G), alanine (Ala., A), Valine (Val, V), leucine \n(Leu, L), isoleucine (Ile, I), proline (Pro, P), hydroxyproline, \nphenylalanine (Phe, F), tyrosine (Tyr,Y), tryptophan (Trp, W) \ncysteine (Cys, C), methionine (Met,  M) serine (Ser,  S), \no-phosphoserine, threonine (Thr, T), lysine (LyS, K), arginine \n(Arg, R), histidine (H is, H), aspartate (Asp, D), glutamate \n(Glu,  E),  Y-carboxyglutamate,  asparagine  (ASn,  N), \nglutamine (Gln, Q) and the like. Amino acids also include \nStereoisomers thereof and compounds structurally similar to \nthe  amino acids  or modifications  or derivatives  thereof. \nExemplary amino acids within the scope of the present dis \nclosure include lysine, arginine, serine, glycine, aspartate and \nthe like. \n0058.  The term "peptide\' is inclusive of both straight and \nbranched amino acid chains, as well as cyclic amino acid \nchains, which comprise at least 2 amino acid residues. The \nterms “peptide\' and “polypeptide\' are used interchangeably \nherein. Accordingly, polypeptides according to the present \ndisclosure include two or more amino acids covalently linked \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\ntogether. According to one aspect, the two or more amino \nacids are covalently linked together at least in part by one or \nmore peptide bonds. \n0059.  According to aspects of the present disclosure, mod \nules (compounds) according to Formula I and Formula II \nself-assemble into  Substructures  also  called  Supermacro \ncycles which themselves will self-assemble into nanometer \nscale architectures or structures Such as discrete nanotubular \nassemblies in water or aqueous solutions. Supermacrocycles \nare defined herein as being a number of organic molecules \ncovalently or noncovalently bound together so as to form a \nring structure. For example, compounds of Formula I will \nself-assemble into a 6-merring structure, sometimes referred \nto as a rosette. The process of forming nanotubes with the \nmodules of the present disclosure is hierarchical. In particu \nlar, the modules of the present invention first self-assemble \ninto Supermacrocycles, and then the Supermacrocycles self \nassembly into nanotubes. Such self-assembly is described in \nU.S. Pat. No. 6,696.565. For the compounds of Formula II \nreferred to as twin base linkers, the compounds will also \nassemble into a 6-merring structure. However, a single Super \nmacrocycle formed will include two base layers owing to the \npresence of the two bases in each of the compound of Formula \nII. \n0060  According to preferred aspects of the present dis \nclosure, the compounds of Formula and Formula II include \nlow molecular weight synthetic DNA base analogues referred \nto by the nomenclature CM G. See Fennirietal, J. Am. Chem. \nSoc. 2001, 123,3854-3855. The CAG moiety, referred to as \na single CM G motif, possess the Watson-Crick donor-donor \nacceptor of guanine and the acceptor-acceptor-donor of \ncytosine and undergoes a self-assembly process, fueled by an \narray of hydrogen bonds, to produce a six-membered Super \nmacrocycle or rosette. Stacking of these rosettes produced a \nnanotube of very high aspect ratio. Compounds within the \nscope of the present invention include a twin G M C motif \ndenoted as (CMG). Like the single CMG motif, the twin C \nm G motif (CMG), also possesses the Watson-Crick donor \ndonor-acceptor of guanine and the acceptor-acceptor-donor \nof cytosine and undergoes a self assembly process, fueled by \nan array of hydrogen bonds, to produce a six-membered \nSupermacrocycle or ring structure (rosette) of twin configu \nration. Stacking of these twin rosettes produces a nanotube of \nvery high aspect ratio and higher stability. \n0061.  It should be understood that the above described \nFormula I  and Formula II  demonstrate that electrostatic, \nstacking and hydrophobic interactions can be effectively \norchestrated by hydrogen bonds to direct the hierarchical \nassembly and organization of helical nanotubular architec \ntures in an aqueous milieu. Helical nanotubular architectures \nwithin  the scope of the present invention include those \nformed entirely from compounds of Formula I. Helical nano \ntubular architectures within the scope of the present invention \ninclude those formed entirely from compounds of Formula II. \nFurther, helical nanotubular architectures within the scope of \nthe present invention include those formed from one or more \nof the compounds of Formula I and one or more of the com \npounds of Formula II. For example, a Supermacrocycle ring \nSubstructure having particular amino acid or polypeptide side \nchains formed from the compounds of Formula I can be \nstacked with a Supermacrocycle ring Substructure having par \nticular amino acid or polypeptide side chains formed from \ncompounds of Formula II. The rosette substructures formed \nfrom the compounds of Formula I and Formula II can be \n\nstacked in any desired sequence to form nanotubular struc \ntures of the present invention. Utilizing this aspect of the \npresent invention, a wide variety of structurally different \nmodules (i.e.  molecules) can be synthesized and self-as \nsembled into Supermacrocycles and then nanotubular struc \ntures according to methods of the present invention. \n0062  According to certain aspects of the present disclo \nSure, nanotubes range in lengths between about 1  nm and \nabout 999 microns, about 1 nm to about 500 nm, about 10 nm. \nto about 300 nm, or about 20 nm to about 100 nm. The \nnanotubes range in diameters between about 1 angstrom and \nabout 100 nm, about 1 nm to about 30 nm, or from about 3 nm. \nto about 15 nm. The openings or inner diameters through the \nnanotubes range in diameters between about 1 angstrom and \nabout 100 nm, about 1 nm to about 30 nm, or from about 3 nm. \nto about 15 nm. According to certain embodiments, the open \ning or inner diameter through the nanotube has a diameter of \nabout 1  nm. According to certain embodiments, the nano \ntubes formed from the twin base linkers of formula II have a \ndifferent opening or inner diameter compared to nanotubes \nformed from the compounds of formula I. This aspect which \nallows for the incorporation into the nanotube of different \nsizes of agents, such as nucleic acids. \n0063.  According to certain preferred aspects of the present \ninvention, a nanotube is prepared from single base ring struc \ntures and twin base ring structures in any desired order. The \nnanotube can have one or more single base ring structures and \none or more twin base ring structures. Likewise, a nanotube \nwithin the scope of the present invention can include a plu \nrality of single base ring structures formed from compounds \nof Formula I and a plurality of twin base ring structures \nformed from compounds of Formula II stacked together, i.e. \none next to the other via hydrogen bonding, to form the \nnanotube. \n0064.  As may be used herein, the terms “nucleic acid.” \n“nucleic acid molecule.” “nucleic acid oligomer.” “oligo \nnucleotide.” “nucleic acid sequence.” “nucleic acid frag \nment” and “polynucleotide\' are used interchangeably and are \nintended to include, but are not limited to, a polymeric form of \nnucleotides covalently linked together that may have various \nlengths, either deoxyribonucleotides or ribonucleotides, or \nanalogs, derivatives or modifications thereof. Different poly \nnucleotides may have different three-dimensional structures, \nand may perform various functions, known or unknown. \nNon-limiting examples of polynucleotides include a gene, a \ngene fragment, an exon, an intron, intergenic DNA (includ \ning, without limitation, heterochromatic DNA), messenger \nRNA (mRNA), transfer RNA, ribosomal RNA, a ribozyme, \ncDNA, a recombinant polynucleotide, a branched polynucle \notide, a plasmid, a vector, isolated DNA of a sequence, iso \nlated RNA of a sequence, a nucleic acid probe, and a primer. \nPolynucleotides useful in the methods of the invention may \ncomprise natural nucleic acid sequences and variants thereof, \nartificial nucleic acid sequences, or a combination of Such \nsequences. As used herein, one of skill in the art will under \nstand that the term “nucleic acid probe\' includes probes \nknown as molecular beacons which include synthetic oligo \nnucleotide hybridization probes that can report the presence \nof specific nucleic acids in homogenous solutions or in cells. \nSpecies of molecular beacons include hairpin shaped mol \necules with an internally quenched fluorophore whose fluo \nrescence is restored when they bind to a target nucleic acid \nsequence. Technically, molecular beacons can be designed to \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\nacid \n\nuracil-5-oxyacetic \n\ntarget any gene and can be linked with fluorescent molecules \nof different fluorescence wavelengths. \n0065.  A polynucleotide is typically composed of, a spe \ncific sequence of four nucleotide bases: adenine (A): cytosine \n(C); guanine (G); and thymine (T) (uracil (U) for thymine (T) \nwhen the polynucleotide is RNA). Thus, the term “polynucle \notide sequence\' is the alphabetical representation of a poly \nnucleotide molecule; alternatively, the term may be applied to \nthe polynucleotide molecule itself. This alphabetical repre \nsentation can be input into databases in a computer having a \ncentral processing unit and used for bioinformatics applica \ntions such as functional genomics and homology searching. \nPolynucleotides may optionally include one or more non \nstandard nucleotide(s), nucleotide analog(s) and/or modified \nnucleotides. \n0066  Examples of modified nucleotides include, but are \nnot limited to 5-fluorouracil, 5-bromouracil, 5-chlorouracil, \n5-iodouracil,  hypoxanthine,  Xantine,  4-acetylcytosine, \n5-(carboxyhydroxylmethyl)uracil, \n5-carboxymethylami \nnomethyl-2-thiouridine, \n5-carboxymethylaminomethylu \nracil,  dihydrouracil,  beta-D-galactosylqueosine,  inosine, \nN6-isopentenyladenine, 1-methylguanine, 1-methylinosine, \n2,2-dimethylguanine,  2-methyladenine,  2-methylguanine, \n3-methylcytosine,  5-methylcytosine, N6-adenine, 7-meth \nylguanine, 5-methylaminomethyluracil, 5-methoxyaminom \nethyl-2-thiouracil,  beta-D-mannosylqueosine,  5\'-methoxy \ncarboxymethyluracil, 5-methoxyuracil, 2-methylthio-D46 \n(V). \nisopentenyladenine, \nWybutoxosine, pseudouracil, queosine, 2-thiocytosine, 5-me \nthyl-2-thiouracil, 2-thiouracil, 4-thiouracil, 5-methyluracil, \nuracil-5-oxyacetic acid methylester, uracil-5-oxyacetic acid \n(v),  5-methyl-2-thiouracil,  3-(3-amino-3-N-2-carboxypro \npyl) uracil, (acp3)w, 2,6-diaminopurine and the like. Nucleic \nacid molecules may also be modified at the base moiety, Sugar \nmoiety or phosphate backbone. \n0067.  According  to  certain  aspects,  nucleic  acids  or \npolypeptides includes small RNA being a duplex of between \nabout 10 to about 30 nucleic acids, between about 15 to about \n25 nucleic acids and between about 20 to about 23 nucleic \nacids, and any values and ranges in between whether over \nlapping or not. The small RNA can be formed by one or more \noligonucleotides.  Small  RNA includes  RNA commonly \nreferred to as interference RNA, dsRNA, ssRNA, saRNA, \nsiRNA or miRNA or their derivatives, analogs, mimics and \ninhibitors. According to certain aspects, siRNA is involved in \nthe RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, where it interferes \nwith the expression of a specific gene. In addition to their role \nin the RNAi pathway, siRNAs also act in the RNAi-related \npathways. siRNA within the scope of the present disclosure \nincludes double stranded RNA of about 21 nucleotides with a \n2 nucleotide 3\' overhang on either end of the siRNA. Each \nsiRNA strand has a 5" phosphate group and a 3’ hydroxyl \n(—OH) group. The structure is the result of processing by \ndicer, an enzyme that converts either long dsRNAs or small \nhairpin RNAs into siRNAs. Particular exemplary sequences \nof siRNA are readily available to those of skill in the art \nthrough published literature and siRNA is  commercially \navailable from, for example, Qiagen. It is to be understood \nthat the present disclosure is not to be limited to any particular \nsiRNA sequence, but rather the present disclosure broadly \ndescribes the incorporation of siRNA into or with rosette \nnanotubes. One of skill in the art will readily recognize that all \nsiRNA sequences, given the similar structure and function of \ncovalently connected nucleotides, can be incorporated into or \n\ncomplexed  with  rosette  nanotubes  using  the  methods \ndescribed herein and that an exhaustive listing of publicly \nknown siRNA sequences need not be provided herein. \n0068  According to additional aspects, DNA includes any \nDNA desired to be expressed by a cell. DNA includes genes \nhaving known functions and expressing known proteins. \nLikewise, DNA suitable for transfecting a cell will be appar \nent to those of skill in the art of transfection and gene expres \nS1O. \n0069.  The present disclosure is directed to methods of \nforming a transfection complex, for example, by mixing one \nor more nucleic acids with fully formed rosette nanotubes or \nmodules that self-assemble into rosette nanotubes, such as the \ncompounds of formula I  or formula II.  According to one \naspect, fully formed rosette nanotubes in the form of a powder \nis dissolved in water and heated to boiling. The solution is \nthen cooled to room temperature. One or more nucleic acids \nin the form of a solution is then added to the solution of \nnanotubes at a suitable temperature and for a suitable period \nof time until a complex of the nanotube and one or more \nnucleic acids forms. Suitable ratios of the nucleic acid to \nnanotube include about 0.01:1 (wit/wt) to about 1:0.1 (wt/wt). \n0070  The invention is  further directed to  transfection \ncomplexes, which include small RNA, such as siRNA and a \nrosette nanotube. Transfection complexes in accordance with \nthe present invention may include any of the rosette nano \ntubes of the present invention in combination with small RNA \nknown to those of skill in the art. \n0071  According to certain aspects, cells within the scope \nof the present invention that can be transfected include osteo \nblasts, fibroblasts, endothelial cells, stem cells, keratinocytes, \ncardiac myocytes, chondrocytes, synoviocytes, mesenchy \nmal stem cells,  neural stem cells, islet cells, hepatocytes, \nSmooth muscle cells, urothelial cells, neurons, Schwann cells, \nmicroglial cells, cancerous and non cancerous cells, epithelial \ncells, endothelial cells, myofibroblasts, osteoclasts, macroph \nages, leukocytes, osteocytes, astrocytes etc. and the like. \nAdditional cells include bacterial cells such as Staphylococ \ncus aureus, Staphylococcus epidermis, Pseudomonas aerugi \nnosa, MRSA, E. coli, candida (yeast), Candida albacans, \nStreptococcus pneumoniae, Neisseria meningitides, Haemo \nphilus influenzae, Streptococcus agalactiae, Listeria mono \ncytogenes, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydia pneumo \nniae, Legionella pneumophila, Mycobacterium, tuberculosis, \nStreptococcus pyogenes, Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria \ngonorrhoeae,  Treponema pallidum,  Ureaplasma urealyti \ncum, Haemophilus ducreyi,  Helicobacter pylori, Campylo \nbacter jejuni, Salmonella, Shigella, Clostridium, Enterobac \nteriaceae, Staphylococcus saprophyticus and the like.

Since complexes of the \nrosette  nanotubes  and  nucleic  acids  are  composed  of \ncovalently bound base pairs, one of skill would expect that \nsuch complexes will be universally recognized by all cell \ntypes for transfecting purposes. \n0078  Methods of transfecting cells in accordance with the \npresent invention may also include forming the transfection \ncomplex by combining in aqueous media the modules of the \nrosette nanotube and one or more DNA sequences and/or one \nor more RNA sequences. The complex is allowed to form. \n\nCells are then contacted with the complex. According to one \naspect, one of skill in the art will recognize from the benefit of \nthe present disclosure that doses, concentrations, ratios and \nconditions of RNT/nucleic acids incorporation can be within \nranges. For example, between about 1 uL to about 100 uL, for \nexample 10 uL, of 1 mg/mL RNTs can be mixed with about 4 \nuL to about 100LL, for example 20LL, of 5uM nucleic acids, \nsuch as siRNA, miRNA, nucleic acid probes or other nucleic \nacids, at a temperature of between about 0°C. to about 37°C. \nfor between about 0.5 hours to about 48 hours and added into \n1  mL cell culture medium for transfection. For example, the \ncombination of RNT and nucleic acids can be maintained at \n4°C. for 24 hours or can be maintained at room temperature \nfor two hours. Mixing can be accomplished by simple mixing, \nmixing while heating to about 60° C. to about 100° C., soni \ncation or other methods known to those of skill in the art. If \nheated, the combination may then be subjected to a tempera \nture of between about 0°C. to about 37° C. for between about \n0.5 hours to about 48 hours to result information or assembly \nof the nanotube/nucleic acid complex. \n007.9  The present invention also provides methods of \ntreating diseases comprising using the complexes or compo \nsitions of the present invention. In particular, methods are \nprovided for treating a patient having a disease, by adminis \ntering to the patient a therapeutically effective amount of a \ncomplex or composition of the present invention. For in vivo \ntherapies based on local injection (e.g., intratumoral, intra \nmuscularly, into the peritoneal cavity, intracardiac, and aero \nsolized treatments) the RNT/small RNA complex is advanta \ngeously water soluble and so may be administered as an \naqueous injection. \n0080.  In accordance with certain examples, complexes of \nthe present invention can be incorporated into pharmaceutical \ncompositions suitable for administration.

As used herein the term \n“pharmaceutically acceptable carrier  is intended to include \nany and all solvents; dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial \nand antifungal  agents,  isotonic and absorption  delaying \nagents, and the like, compatible with pharmaceutical admin \nistration. The use of Such media and agents for pharmaceuti \ncally active substances is well known in the art. Exceptinsofar \nas any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the \nactive compound, use thereof in the compositions is contem \nplated. Supplementary active compounds can also be incor \nporated into the compositions. \nI0081.  In accordance with certain examples, a pharmaceu \ntical composition of the invention is formulated to be com \npatible with its intended route of administration.

The following examples are specific embodiments \nof the present invention but are not intended to limit it. \n\nCell Culture of Chondrocytes \n0089.  Primary mouse chondrocytes were isolated from the \nrib cage of 5 days old mice. Human chondrocyte cell line \nC2812 and ADTC5 mouse chondrocyte were incubated in \ngrowth media including DMEM/F12 supplement with 10% \nfetal calf serum. \n\nExample 1 \n\nExample 2 \n\nPreparation of RNT/Nucleic Acid Complexes \n0090  According to an aspect of the present disclosure, \nnucleic acids are incorporated or complexed with rosette \n\nnanotubes formed from the compounds of Formula I (RNTs) \nor with rosette nanotubes formed from the compounds of \nFormula II (TBLs). RNTs were formed using a compound of \nFormula I where R is methyl, X is nitrogen, R is the linker \n(CH2) and Y is lysine. TBLS were formed using a compound \nof Formula II where R is methyl, X is nitrogen, R is the \nlinker (CH) and Y is NH. Specifically and without limi \ntation, 1 mg of modules of rosette nanotubes in powder form \nwere dissolved in 1  ml of distilled water and sonicated and \nheated to boiling so that rosette nanotubes were formed. The \nstructures of the rosette nanotubes were described in U.S. Pat. \nNo. 6,696,565; Fenniri, J. Am. Chem. Soc, 2001, 123,3854 \n3855; and Moralez, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 8307-8309 \neach of which are hereby incorporated by reference in their \nentireties. One particular module forming the rosette nano \ntube is shown in FIG. 1. The solution was cooled to room \ntemperature. 2 ul of the solution was mixed with 45 ul of an \nsiRNA solution containing 0.16 nmol FITC labeled siRNA \n(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at 4C overnight. \n0091  Alternatively,  modules  of rosette  nanotubes  as \ndescribed above in powder form are combined with a water \nand a solution of an siRNA solution containing FITC labeled \nsiRNA (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) are sonicated and heated \nto boiling. The combination is then cooled to room tempera \nture and maintained at 4°C. overnight. \n0092  Alternatively, purified rosette nanotubes were ster \nilized in boiled water. 0.5 ng/ml rosette nanotubes were incu \nbated with  100 nmol FITC labeled Scrambled siRNA or \nHDAC4 siRNAs (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) at CC for over \nnight. \n0093  Small RNAs were incorporated into and complexed \nwith rosettes nanotubes. 1 uL of 50M scrambled siRNA was \nincorporated with 5 uL of 1 mg/mL RNTs according to the \nmethod described above. Then, the solution was added into 1 \nmL water for UV-Vis measurement. Solutions of siRNA only \nand RNT only were also prepared at the same concentration \nas above for UV-Vis measurement. As shown in FIG. 2, the \nincorporation was determined by a lower light absorbance of \nthe RNT/siRNA composites in UV-Vis spectroscopy com \npared with the total absorbance of siRNA and RNTs tested \nseparately. This demonstrated that the small RNA and the \nRNTs were physically mixed together and with their bases \nalso packed together. \n0094  Moreover, a CD spectroscopy was applied to detect \nthe change in the chirality of RNT/siRNA composites and to \nverify their physical incorporation. 1 uL of 50 uM scrambled \nsiRNA was incorporated with 5uL of 1 mg/mL RNTs accord \ning to the method described above. Then, the solution was \nadded into 1  mL water for CD spectroscopy. Solutions of \nsiRNA only and RNT only were also prepared at the same \nconcentration as above for the experiment. As shown in FIG. \n3, a change of molecular chirality demonstrated the incorpo \nration between RNTS and siRNA. \n0.095  Thermo analysis experiments were conducted to \ndetermine disassembly of the siRNAs from RNTs. 1 uL of 50 \nuM scrambled siRNA was incorporated with  5 uL of 1 \nmg/mL RNTs as the method mentioned above. Then, the \nsolution was added into 0.3 mL water for thermo analysis. \nTemperatures increased from 4°C. to 99°C. with 1 minute \nequilibrium time at every temperature. RNT only solution \nwas also prepared at the same concentration as above. As \nshown in FIG. 4, transition temperatures of RNTs in RNT/ \nsiRNA composites in  thermo analysis experiments were \nlower than the melting temperatures of RNTs alone. This \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\ndemonstrated the ability of siRNAs to disassemble from \nRNTs so that after delivery into a cell, siRNA could release \nfrom RNTs for desired functions. \n0096  Electrophoresis was carried out to determine the \nincorporation of siRNAs into RNTs. 1 u, of 50 uMscrambled \nsiRNA was incorporated with or without 5 uL of 1 mg/mL \nRNTs according to the method described above. 4% agarose \ngel was prepared for electrophoresis with ethidium bromide \nas fluorescence stain. Then, RNT/siRNA and RNT solution \nwere mixed glycerol and the gel was run under 30V at 4°C. \nfor 2 hours. Electrophoresis demonstrated the incorporation \nbetween RNTs and siRNAs and RNT/siRNA composites \nhave a neutral total charge compared to negatively charged \nsiRNA as shown in FIG. 5. \n0097  Atomic force microscopic studies were carried out \nto analyze the surface of a network of RNTs and RNT/siRNA \ncomposites.  RNT/siRNA composites  were  prepared  as \ndescribed above. 6 ul acetone was added to 10ul of a solution \nof RNT/siRNA solution and a drop placed onto a clean glass \nslide. After air-drying, the glass slide was analyzed under \natomic force microscopy. As shown in FIG. 6, RNTs formed \na network morphology in a relatively high concentration. As \nshown in  FIG. 7A, RNTs complexed with small  RNAs \nshowed regions of regions RNAs referred to as “clots’ indi \ncated by circles and “bundles\' indicated by the arrow. Trans \nmission electron microscopy was also used to analyze the \nmorphologies of RNTs and RNT/siRNA composites. RNT/ \nsiRNA composites were prepared as described above. A cop \nper grid was dip into RNT or RNT/siRNA solutions. After \nair-drying, the copper grid was negatively stained with uranyl \nacetate and analyzed under transmission electron micros \ncopy. As shown in FIG. 7(B), RNTs formed a network mor \nphology. Consistent with atomic force microscopy: FIG.7(C) \nshows that RNTs complexed with small RNAs and experi \nenced a morphological transformation from net-work struc \ntures to particle-like structures. \n\nExample 3 \nChondrocytes Transfected with RNT/siRNA \nComplexes \n0098.  To visualize internalization of siRNA by RNT deliv \nery into chondrocytes, RNTS/FITC-siRNA complex were \nadded into ADTC5 mouse chondrocyte cell lines and incu \nbated for 24 hours. The transfected cells were washed twice \nwith PBS and then fixed in 4% formalin. Thereafter, cells \nwere permeabilized with PBS/0.1% TritonX-100 and stained \nwith HDAC4 antibody and incubated with DAPI for nuclear \ncounterstaining. Confocal imaging was performed with a \nZeiss AXiovert confocal laser scanning microscope. Fluores \ncence microscopy of the treated cells revealed internalized \nRNT/SiRNA. FIG. 8 depicts light (A and C) and fluorescent \n(Band D) pictures of chondrocytes cultured with only FITC \nRNA (A and B) or with FITC-RNA-RNTs (C and D). As \nshown in FIG.8B, fluorescence labeled siRNA alone was not \nable to enter the cells. After incubation of fluorescent labeled \nsiRNA with RNT as a carrier, the cells showed intracellular \ngreen fluorescent signals as shown in FIG. 8D. This demon \nstrates efficient uptake of RNT/RNA by chondrocytes. \n\nExample 4 \nPrimary Chondrocytes Transfected with RNT/siRNA \nComplexes \n0099]  To test whether RNT can carry siRNA into primary \nchondrocytes, mouse primary chondrocytes were incubated \n\nwith RNT/siRNA complex for 24 hours and observed by \nconfocal microscophy. Briefly, the cells were washed twice \nwith PBS and then fixed in 4% formalin. Thereafter, cells \nwere permeabilized with PBS/0.1% TritonX-100 and stained \nwith rhodamine and incubated with DAPI for nuclear coun \nterstaining. The internalized HDAC4 siRNA accumulated in \nthe cytoplasm and colocalized with HDAC4 protein as shown \nin FIG. 9. In particular, FIGS. 9(E) and 9(F) are 2D and 3D \nimages of green fluorescent siRNA delivered by RNTs inside \na chondrocyte. Red fluorescence indicates the cytoskeleton \nand blue fluorescence indicates the cell nuclei. \n\nExample 5 \n\nInhibition of Protein Expression Using RNT/siRNA \nComplexes \n0100.  To evaluate the ability of RNT/siRNA complex to \ninterfere with RNA in primary mouse chondrocytes, RNA \nwas isolated and HDAC4 gene silencing was evaluated by \nreal-time PCR. Chondrocytes were lyzed in RIPA lysis buffer \nand equal amount of cell lysates were separated by 10% \nSDS-PAGE and transferred on a nitrocellulose membrane. \nMembranes were blot with HDAC4 or Actin antibody. Immu \nnoblotting coupled with fluorescent signal detection with an \nOdyssey fluorescence  scanner.  As shown in  FIG.  10A, \nexpression level of HDAC4 mRNA was suppressed by nearly \n80%. As shown in FIG. 10B, Western blot analysis indicated \nthat HDAC4 protein expression was successfully inhibited. \nThe efficient gene silencing indicates that siRNA delivered by \nRNT was functional in the cells. FIG. 10C depicts the quan \ntitative analysis of the Western blots of FIG. 10B demonstrat \ning that siRNAs were highly functional after delivery by \nRNTs into cells. \n\nExample 6 \n\nAlteration of miRNA Expression Using \nRNT/miR365 Mimic or Inhibitor Complexes \n0101  To evaluate the ability of RNTs to deliver miRNA \nmimic into cells, RNT/miR365 mimic complexes were pre \npared using the methods described above. Human chondro \ncytes (C2812) were contacted with the complexes and then \nthe expression levels of miR365 were determined. Briefly, \ntotal RNA was extracted from cells using a commercially \navailable kit by following the manufacturer\'s instructions. \nThen, the RNA was reverse transcribed using the miscript \nreverse transcription kit and analyzed by real-time PCR using \nthe appropriate miscript primer assay as per the manufactur \ner\'s instructions. For gene expression assay, the same amount \nof RNA was used for each sample. The 18 S RNA was \namplified at the same time and used as an internal control. As \nshown in FIG. 11, the RNT/miR365 mimic complexes suc \ncessfully delivered miR365 mimic into cells and the delivered \nmiR365 mimic was functional to  increase miR365 gene \nexpression. \n0102)  To evaluate the ability of RNTs to deliver miRNA \ninhibitor into cells, RNT/miR365 inhibitor complexes were \nprepared using the methods described above. Human chon \ndrocytes (C2812) were contacted with the complexes and \nthen the expression levels  of miR365 were determined. \nBriefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using a commer \ncially available kit by following the manufacturers instruc \ntions. Then, the RNA was reverse transcribed using the mis \ncript reverse transcription kit and analyzed by real-time PCR \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\nusing the appropriate miscript primer assay as per the manu \nfacturers instructions. For gene expression assay, the same \namount of RNA was used for each sample. The 18 S RNA was \namplified at the same time and used as an internal control. As \nshown in FIG. 12A, the RNT/miR365 inhibitor complexes \nsuccessfully delivered miR365 inhibitor into the cells and the \ndelivered  miR365  inhibitor  was  functional  to  decrease \nmiR365 gene expression. \n(0103)  To evaluate the ability of RNTs such as TBLs to \ndeliver miRNA inhibitor into cells, TBL/miR365 inhibitor \ncomplexes were prepared using the methods described above. \nHuman chondrocytes (C2812) were contacted with the com \nplexes and then the expression levels of miR365 determined. \nBriefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using a commer \ncially available kit by following the manufacturers instruc \ntions. Then, the RNA was reverse transcribed using the mis \ncript reverse transcription kit and analyzed by real-time PCR \nusing the appropriate miscript primer assay as per the manu \nfacturers instructions. For gene expression assay, the same \namount of RNA was used for each sample. The 18 S RNA was \namplified at the same time and used as an internal control. As \nshown in FIG. 12B, the TBL/miR365 inhibitor complexes \nsuccessfully delivered miR365 inhibitor into the cells and the \ndelivered  miR365  inhibitor  was  functional  to  decrease \nmiR365 gene expression.  As indicated  in  a comparison \nbetween FIG. 12A and FIG.12B, the miR365 inhibitor deliv \nered using rosette nanotubes made from the TBL decreased \nthe miR365 expression to a greater extent than the miR365 \ninhibitor delivered using rosette nanotubes made from the \nRNT. \n\nExample 7 \n\nMouse Chondrocytes (ADTC5) Transfected with \nRNT/Probe Complexes \n0104.  To test whether RNT can carry a nucleic acid probe, \nSuch as a molecular beacon capable of hybridizing with or \notherwise binding to a target gene, RNT/molecular beacon \ncomplexes were prepared using the methods described above. \nMouse chondrocytes (ADTC5) were incubated with RNT/ \nGAPDH molecular beacon targeting GAPDH expression \ncomplex for 24 hours and observed by confocal microscopy. \nBriefly, the cells were washed twice with PBS and then fixed \nin 4% formalin, for confocal. Microscopy. FIG. 13 depicts \nlight (A and C) and fluorescent (B and D) pictures of chon \ndrocytes cultured with only the GAPDH molecular beacon (A \nand B) or with RNT/GAPDH molecular beacon complex (C \nand D). As shown in FIG. 13B, fluorescence labeled GAPDH \nmolecular beacon alone was notable to enter the cells.

The right femur of a 3 month old male \nmouse was injected with the GAPDH molecular beacon in a \n\n30 ul saline solution. The left femur of a 3 month old male \nmouse was injected with the RNT/GAPDH molecular beacon \ncomplex in a 30 ul saline solution. After injection, fluores \ncence molecular tomography was used to measure the fluo \nrescence of the molecular beacons at 30 minutes, 1  day, 3 \ndays, 5 days and 7 days. FIG. 23 shows a significantly higher \nfluorescence signal from the left femur which was injected \nwith the RNT/molecular beacon complex compared to the \nright femur which was injected with the molecular beacon \nonly. This demonstrates that the RNTs were able to deliver the \nmolecular beacons into cells in vivo. \n\nExample 12 \n\nComparison with Lipofectamine \n0116.  The ability of RNTs to deliversiRNA was compared \nwith that of lipofectamine. Briefly, RNT/fluorescence labeled \nsiRNA were prepared using the methods mentioned above \nand Lipofectamine/fluorescence labeled siRNA complexes \nwere prepared as per the standard commercially available \nprotocol.  Mouse chondrocytes (ADTC5) were incubated \nwith RNA only, RNT/RNA and Lipofectamine/RNA for 24 \nhours. Then, the cells were washed with PBS, detached from \nthe culture dishes and fixed by 4% formalin. Flow cytometry \nwas used to determine the percentage of fluorescent cells. \nFluorescence positive  cells  demonstrated  the  uptake  of \nsiRNA. Results demonstrated that RNTS deliver siRNA into \ncells while siRNA alone was not capable of entering cells. \nFlow cytometry data as depicted in FIG. 24 shows that deliv \nery of siRNA into cells was as good as or better than lipo \nfectamine. Especially, RNTs showed a more even distribution \nof fluorescence among cells. \n0117  To compare the ability of RNT and lipofectamine to \ndeliver a GAPDH molecular beacon, RNT/GAPDH molecu \nlar  beacon  complexes  were  prepared  using  methods \ndescribed above and Lipofectamine/GAPDH molecular bea \ncon complexes were prepared as per the standard commer \ncially available protocol. Primary mouse chondrocytes were \nincubated with GAPDH molecular beacon, RNT/GAPDH \nmolecular beacon complexes, and Lipofectamine/GAPDH \nmolecular beacon complexes for 24 hours and observed by \nconfocal microscopy. As shown in FIG. 25, RNTS demon \nstrated  a  significantly  better  delivery  ability  to  deliver \nmolecular beacons into chondrocytes that lipofectamine at \nthe same dose. \n\nExample 13 \n\nDownstream Gene Expression Comparison with \nLipofectamine \n0118.  The ability of RNTs, TBLs and lipofectamine to \ndeliver miR365 mimic into human chondrocytes (C2812) and \nto influence expression of the downstream gene RUNX2 was \ndetermined. Briefly, total RNA was extracted from cells using \na commercially available kit by following the manufacturers \ninstructions. Then, the RNA was reverse transcribed using the \nmiscript reverse transcription kit and analyzed by real-time \nPCR using the appropriate miscript primer assay as per the \nmanufacturers instructions. For gene expression assay, the \nsame amount of RNA was used for each sample. The 18 S \nRNA was amplified at the same time and used as an internal \ncontrol. RNT/miR365 mimic and TBL/miR365 mimic com \nplexes were prepared using the methods described herein and \nlipofectamine/miR365 mimic was prepared as the standard \n\n\x0cUS 2014/0171482 A1 \n\nJun. 19, 2014 \n\ncommercially available protocol. As shown in FIG. 26, deliv \nery of miR365 mimic into cells  using RNTs and TBLs \nincreased expression of the downstream gene RUNX2 and to \na greater extent compared with lipofectamine. \n0119  Given the  benefit  of the  above disclosure  and \ndescription of exemplary embodiments, it will be apparent to \nthose skilled in the art that numerous alternative and different \nembodiments are possible in keeping with the general prin \nciples of the invention disclosed here.
